The case in favour of \ac{ABM} as an approach has been made numerously, and elegantly REFS. As such we will not belabour the point, and instead turn to addressing some of the concerns often expressed about the method. In this instance we focus on the perception of \ac{ABM} as ad hoc in nature, tending to be a reflection of the assumptions of the modeller rather than empirically or theoretically grounded.

%Finishing up

The remainder of this paper proceeds to provide small reviews of alcohol and disclosure in the maternity setting (\ref{sub:alcohol_disclosure}), and the methodological context (\ref{sub:games_signals}), before outlining the model (\ref{sec:model}), and experiments (\ref{sec:method}), with selected results (\ref{sec:results}), then closing with a discussion contrasting the decision models (\ref{sec:conclusion}).
