\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}
%Start this off with a brief description of our fictional scenario.
% Whole section ~ 1.5K

\subsection{Disclosure Game}
\label{sub:the_game}
%Outline how the scenario translates into a game.
%Brief mention of the game theoretic solution


\subsection{Agent Models}
\label{sub:the_agents}
%Outline basic structure, then specifics on each one.
%This should probably go lexic -> bayes payoff -> bayes -> CPT in order
% of complexity.
%suggest there are added shells of complexity
%		mention the info sharing because homophilly
%			related - the enhancement to the bayes/cpt agents is that they personalise, as much as anything.
%		properly explain dirichlet priors

\subsection{Model Implementation}
\label{sub:the_code}
% Use this bit to talk about the practical version of the game and where info is revealed?
