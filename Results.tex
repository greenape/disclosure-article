\subsection{Qualitative Trends}
\label{sub:qt_results}

As shown in figure \ref{fig:qt_honesty}, all four decision rules were able to reproduce both qualitative trends towards more disclosure as women experience more appointments \citep{Phillips2007}, and a greater tendency towards underreporting of consumption by heavier drinkers \citep{Alvik2006}.  Trends for all four rules are broadly similar, exhibiting a gradual increase across appointments which subsequently levels off. This levelling can in part be explained by the referral results (figure \ref{fig:qt_ref}), which show that the majority of drinkers are referred, despite substantial concealment. Referrals continue to occur, in the absence of honest signals, because drinkers are able to achieve a referral by pooling with higher or lower types, dependent on how their initial beliefs are biased.
